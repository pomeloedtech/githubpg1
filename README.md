# githubpg1
My 1st GitHub Repository.
So a year ago I did courses in data analytics without any coding knowledge. 
The last time I had written a program was in 1994 at UCT for a swinging pendulum using a language called Basic. 
I knew that the tech world had a galaxy of jargon to search on Google. 
Jumping into the deep end after 3 decades was a challenge but somehow I got through it.
I am thirsty for more knowledge.
